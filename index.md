## **About Me**
Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) under the supervision of [Prof. Yao Ma](https://yaoma24.github.io/). I received a bachelor's degree in Quantitative Business Analysis and Computer Science from the University of Sydney and a master's degree in Operations Research and Information Engineering from Cornell Tech, Cornell University. I also have work experience at Gap Inc., Cardinal Operations, and EY.
